# Array Sorting

This Java program sorts a 2D array of state names and capitals, then quizzes the user on the capitals. It showcases the implementation of a Bubble Sort algorithm for array sorting and user input handling in Java.

## Overview

The program demonstrates sorting techniques by organizing a 2D array of state names and capitals based on capital cities. It utilizes a Bubble Sort algorithm to arrange the array elements alphabetically by state capitals. After sorting, it engages the user in a quiz, prompting them to input the capital for each state. Finally, it evaluates the correctness of user-provided answers and presents the quiz results.

## Functionality

- Prints and sorts a 2D array of state names and capitals.
- Conducts a quiz by prompting the user to input state capitals.
- Evaluates user-provided answers for correctness.
- Displays quiz results, including the total number of correct answers and the percentage of correct answers.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- Bubble Sort algorithm
- Scanner class for user input handling

## Usage

1. Compile and execute the `BubbleSort.java` file.
2. Review the displayed 2D array of state names and capitals.
3. Complete the quiz by providing the capital for each state as prompted.
4. View the total number of correct answers and the percentage of correct answers after completing the quiz.

## Included Files

- `BubbleSort.java`: Primary Java file containing program logic.

## Acknowledgments

This program serves as an educational tool to demonstrate array sorting and user input handling in Java. It offers an interactive experience for users to learn and test their knowledge of state capitals while showcasing the implementation of sorting algorithms in Java programming.
